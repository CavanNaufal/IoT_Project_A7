## Overview
This project implements ESP32 with BME680 sensor to monitor indoor air quality using BSEC Library and Blynk platform. Here, BME680 is used to measure temperature, humidity, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), and CO2 percentage in the room and display them on the Blynk platform. If there are parameters that exceed the threshold where it can be identified that the air in the room is bad, the program will turn on the alarm (buzzer) and a red light bulb then send an email notification to the user indicating that the air quality around the vicinity of the AirQu is poor.
